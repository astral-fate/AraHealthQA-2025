            "Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n",
            "\n",
            "The question is about a hormone whose secretion increases after birth, and this hormone is essential for maintaining the newborn's body temperature. The options are cortisol, TSH, T4, and T3.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hmm, I remember that after birth, newborns have to adapt to the outside environment, which is quite different from the womb. One of the main challenges is regulating their body temperature. I think the thyroid hormones play a role here because they're involved in metabolism, which affects heat production.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, so the thyroid gland produces T3 and T4. TSH is the hormone that stimulates the thyroid to release these hormones. But which one is more active right after birth?\n",
            "\n",
            "I recall that T3 is the more active form of thyroid hormone. It's responsible for increasing metabolic rate, which in turn generates body heat. So after birth, the baby's thyroid starts working more to produce T3 to help maintain their body temperature.\n",
            "\n",
            "But wait, isn't T4 the main hormone released by the thyroid, and then it's converted to T3 in the tissues? So maybe the question is referring to the increase in T4. Or does it specifically refer to T3?\n",
            "\n",
            "I think the question is about the hormone that's crucial for heat production. T3 is more potent, so maybe the increase is in T3. Alternatively, maybe the question is pointing towards TSH, but TSH is the stimulating hormone, not the one directly causing the effect.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, no, the question says the hormone itself is increased. So it's either T3 or T4. I remember that in newborns, especially premature ones, the levels of T4 might be lower, but T3 might be higher because of the conversion from T4 to T3. Or maybe the surge is in TSH right after birth, which then stimulates the thyroid to release more T4 and T3.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. After birth, the baby's thyroid function increases to help with thermogenesis. The main hormones involved are T3 and T4. TSH is released by the pituitary gland to stimulate the thyroid.\n",
            "\n",
            "So the question is asking which hormone's secretion increases. If TSH increases, that would cause the thyroid to produce more T3 and T4. But the question is about the hormone that's directly involved in maintaining body temperature.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is TSH because it's the hormone that's increased, which then leads to more thyroid hormones. But I'm not sure. I think the direct effect on metabolism and heat is from T3 and T4.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, another angle: the question says \"after birth, there's an increase in the secretion of hormone X, which is necessary for maintaining the newborn's body temperature.\" So the hormone X is the one that's increased, not the one causing the increase.\n",

            "So if the baby's TSH increases, that would cause the thyroid to produce more T3 and T4. But the hormone that's directly involved in heat production is T3 and T4.\n",
            "\n",
            "I think the correct answer is TSH because it's the hormone that's secreted in higher amounts after birth to stimulate the thyroid. But wait, no, the question is about the hormone that's necessary for maintaining body temperature, which would be the thyroid hormones themselves.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to remember. I think that after birth, the levels of TSH surge, which then causes the thyroid to release more T4 and T3. But the hormone that's directly responsible for the metabolic rate and heat is T3.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to T4 because it's the main hormone produced by the thyroid. But I'm not entirely sure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, another thought: in adults, T3 is the active form, but in newborns, the conversion from T4 to T3 is crucial. So maybe the increase is in T4, which is then converted to T3.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I'm not certain. I think the correct answer is TSH because it's the hormone that increases to stimulate the thyroid. But no, the question is about the hormone that's necessary for body temperature, which would be the thyroid hormones.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again. The options are cortisol, TSH, T4, and T3.\n",
            "\n",
            "Cortisol is a stress hormone, but it's not primarily involved in thermogenesis. TSH stimulates the thyroid. T4 and T3 are the thyroid hormones.\n",
            "\n",
